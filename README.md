### Overview

From the website: 
> Welcome, my name is Liam Barnard. I'm currently a Cloud Support Engineer with a keen interest in Computer Science.
> I started my career in the surveying industry straight out of college, I didn't take my first real steps into the IT industry until joining Onecom as a Cloud Support Engineer in late 2021. I've always spent time in front of a screen be it gaming, studying or working. Contrary to my mothers belief, my eyes are not yet square so I aspire to continue in the industry learning and progressing as much as I can.
